	<h2> Quadris </h2>

	<p>
	Quadris is a tetris-like game that was implemented using C++ as the final project of my Object-Oriented Programming course at the University of Waterloo.

	<p>
	To play the game, the user will be given randomized blocks that they must try to drop into a desirable position. Upon reaching a full row, the row will be cleared and points awarded. The objective is to continue clearing rows. The game ends when the user is unable to place their current block without touching the top of the screen. This game differs from traditional tetris by waiting for the user's input at each stage.

	<p>
	The game can be played through the command line, or with a visual GUI using X11.

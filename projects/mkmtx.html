	<h2> Town of Markham Tax View </h2>

	<p>
	This was a project done for the town of Markham to allow residents to manage their property taxes online.
	First a resident will request a tax PIN. Then, using the PIN, the resident is able to sign up for the self-serve online tax service.
	Then, the resident will be able to view bills, and sign up for eBilling.
